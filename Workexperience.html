  <p>My first work experience was at CodeFever , CodeFever is a company that teaches little kids programming in a fun and engaging way. I worked there for about 3 years (from 16 until i was 19). I think i learned a lot during this job because i learned to teach some basic programming concepts in a way that even little kids could understand it and i also learned to work with my collegues which i will need given that a lot of coding jobs are set in a team setting.</p>
